# HPC-Cluster Deployment using XCAT

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

This project facilitates the deployment of a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster using the Extreme Cluster/Cloud Administration Toolkit (XCAT). XCAT is a powerful tool designed to simplify the management and provisioning of nodes in HPC and cloud environments.

### Features

- **Automated Deployment:** Streamline the deployment process for HPC clusters.
- **Node Management:** Efficiently manage and configure compute nodes in the cluster.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale your cluster by adding or removing nodes.
- **Flexibility:** Support for various HPC configurations and architectures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have XCAT installed on your management node.
- [List any additional prerequisites or dependencies]
